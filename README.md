### Our Mission?
Our mission is to help aspiring Software Engineers become the best they possibly can, and give them guidance in their journey into the field. There is a lot of career advice out there, but a lot of it isn't great. We want to provide a one stop shop where developers can go and have all of their questions answered.

### How can I help?
